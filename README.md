This Python code enables communication between a browser and ydotool, which must be installed on your system, using the native messaging protocol (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) to control the mouse and keyboard from a browser extension.

The code utilizes a mouse trajectory generator from https://github.com/riflosnake/HumanCursor.

The `install.sh` script is designed to work with Python 3, Firefox, and the `requestShark` extension. If you intend to use this code to control the mouse from a different browser or extension, you will need to edit `install.sh` and `mkb_driver.json`.
